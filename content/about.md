Hi, I am Rohan. I am based off NCR, India.
I am a backend developer with keen interest in DevOps.
I mostly work with Python and Django. I can also work with golang and Js.
I like to use bleeding edge technology. Some of the technologies I've worked with on production are:

+ Django
+ Kafka
+ Elasticsearch
+ Redis
+ Etc.

I love designing scalable backend architectures and deployment strategies.
I adore simple and clean code. I like to see elegant code and also make some, now and then.
