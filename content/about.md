Hi, I am Rohan. I am 24 years old and hail from a town called Rudrapur in Uttarakhand. I am currently based in Gurugram, Haryana, and working as SDE2 at Park+. I am a backend developer with a keen interest in DevOps. I mostly work with Python and Django. I can also work with golang and Js. I like to use bleeding-edge technology.
Some of the technologies Iâ€™ve worked with on production are:

- Django
- Docker/Docker Compose
- Kafka
- Elasticsearch
- Redis
- Etc.

I love designing scalable back-end architectures and improvising deployment strategies. I adore simple and clean code. I like to see elegant code and also make some, now and then.
If you are a potential employer:

1. Most of my work is private for obvious reasons BUT I am more than happy to discuss it privately.
2. You can obtain the latest copy of my resume from my public drive
