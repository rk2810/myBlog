Hi, I am Rohan. I am 24 years old and hail from a town called Rudrapur in Uttarakhand.
I am currently based off Gurugram, Haryana and working as SDE2 at [Park+](https://parkplus.io/).
I am a backend developer with keen interest in DevOps.
I mostly work with Python and Django. I can also work with golang and Js.
I like to use bleeding edge technology. Some of the technologies I've worked with on production are:

+ Django
+ Docker/Docker Compose
+ Kafka
+ Elasticsearch
+ Redis
+ Etc.

I love designing scalable backend architectures and improvising deployment strategies.
I adore simple and clean code. I like to see elegant code and also make some, now and then.

If you are a potential employer:
 1. Most of my work is private for obvious reasons *BUT* I am more than happy to discuss about it privately.
 2. You can obtain latest copy of my resume from [here](/resume.pdf)
